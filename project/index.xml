      <description>Introduction The datasets I chose for this project consist of information regarding national parks, unemployment rate, and gas prices. The national park dataset contains annual visitation numbers for each park from 1904 to 2016 in addition to the state and region the park resides in, its geometry, and ID number. The Unemployment dataset contains the percentage of unemployment for each year from 1941-2010 in addition to other information regarding population numbers, labor force, and percentage of employment.</description>

      <description>Introduction The dataset I have chosen for this project consists of information regarding the backpack weight of 100 college-aged subjects in pounds, their respective body weight in pounds, whether or not they have back problems (0=no,1=yes), their major, year in school, sex, and how many class hours they were currently taking when filling out the survey. I chose this backpack dataset because I have always had back pain due to my heavy backpack, and I am interested to see if there are any other variables that may affect this issue.</description>
